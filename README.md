This project was written as part of an assignment for a class at Spokane Community College. Some assistance was needed, but the majority of the code, including the main theme as an original concept, was done by Kain Vincent.
The original files of the project have not been updated, and there may be faults or errors in the look of the pages when viewed in a browser. Images included in the project were also procured from the internet.
